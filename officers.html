                    Luis Fonseca is a senior at Doral Academy High School. He has been competing since 6th grade in math competitions, but joined FLSAM and started taking competitions more seriously in 8th/9th, and has competed in FAMAT, Mathcounts, AMC series, CMIMC, PUMaC and more. His favorite type of math is number theory and he dislikes most geometry (aphantasia) and he enjoys writing problems and making resources for others. Outside of math, he may be found loudly insulting his friends, napping, procrastinating homework, listening to objectively bad music, gambling (legally), and with his greatest accomplishment (his own words) his girlfriend.
